Cleaned the data such as removing the null values, dealing with the outliers and finding correlation coefficient between each variables

Developed linear regression model and did selected optimal features using mean squared error and r2_score for best prediction 

Compared different sets of combination of features with the target variable and also different sets of training dataset to see how the mean squared error change with different training dataset
